# 2023-digital-t-level-apprentice

Welcome to the main branch of this repo.

Please see the [Glossary](./GLOSSARY.MD) for descriptions of some keywords we'll be using. Also please see the [Common commands](/COMMON-COMMANDS.MD) for some common git commands.

You may need to get permission to install the [git command line application for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) before you can perform a lot of these actions. If you would prefer, you can install the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/) - this will wrap all of the git CLI commands in a UI.

This repo has some GitHub specific files (in the [.github directory](./.github/)) which are designed to make things a little easier to manage from an infrastructure point of view. These files form the basis of some basic [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) practises. Please note that by default this directory might be hidden from view, as it is known as a "dot directory" and by default these folders are hidden from view.

## Directories

A number of directories have been created in this repo. These directories represent the standard layout for RJJ-based projects.

## Tasks

Prior to this version of the repo, there was a "Tasks" section of the readme. This section has been deleted (though recoverable in source control if we need it), as the tasks have been completed.
