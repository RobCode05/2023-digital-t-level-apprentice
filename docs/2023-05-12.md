Today (May 12th, 2023) we covered the following:

- Setup a new laptop (ThinkPad T480 running Windows 11) together
- Installed Visual Studio 2022 + .NET 6
- Added Avalonia UI templates
- Attempted to build an Avalonia UI app
- Started creating a slightly functional MVP of the WPF app

The following topics were mentioned, but not covered in detail:

- [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/)
- [Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science))†
- [Auto Implemented Properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties)

† Polymorphism is the basis of most object oriented programming. Suppose we have a class called `Game`

``` csharp
public class Game
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
}
```

and another two classes called `BoardGame` and `VideoGame`:

``` csharp

public enum Type
{
    Card,
    Dice,
    DnD
}
public Genre
{
    Football,
    FPS,
    RPG
}

public class BoardGame
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public Enum Type { get; set; }
}
public class VideoGame
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public GameGenre Genre { get; set; }
}
```

Since all three classes have common properties (i.e. `Title`), we can use polymorphism to encapsulate the common properties into the `Game` class and have both `BoardGame` and `VideoGame` inherit those properties - similar to how a child might inherit genetic properties of their parents.

To do this, we would alter the three classes like this:

``` csharp
public class Game
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
}
public class BoardGame : Game
{
    public Enum Type { get; set; } //can be Card, Dice or DnD
}
public class VideoGame : Game
{
    public GameGenre Genre { get; set; } // can be Football, FPS, RPG
}
```

This allows all three different classes to have the `Title` property, but it also means that methods which take any of the three games as an argument can take the base (i.e. `Game`) as an input, like so:

```csharp
public void SomeGameMethod(Game inputGame)
{
    // do something with inputGame
}

// the above can be called with all three types of game class
var base = new Game();
var board = new BoardGame();
var video = new VideoGame();

// All three of these calls are legal, since each is (essentially)
// an instance of the Game class
SomeGameMethod(base);
SomeGameMethod(board);
SomeGameMethod(video);
```

All three classes have the same proper
